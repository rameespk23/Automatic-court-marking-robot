We’ve invented and developed Automatic court marker which is the  first robot for doing line marking on sports complexes autonomously.
Our project idea is to solve a problem with marking courts. Automatic court marker is being positioned as the first automatic robot for court marking. In sport fields we have seen manual court markers that take lot of time to draw a court. The existing mechanism takes a lot of human effort,time and energy. To solve this problem, we came up with our project “Automatic court marker”. Court marking of sports facilities is manual, time-consuming and resource intensive task. Groundsmen, track managers, volunteers and municipalities often do the task. We’ve invented and developed Automatic court marker which is the  first robot for doing line marking on sports complexes autonomously. This means that we eliminate the need for an operator while getting a much more precise and sustainable result. Automatic court marker is a versatile and flexible court marking system that could draw multiple types of courts.
